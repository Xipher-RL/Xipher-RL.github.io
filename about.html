                <h1>Hello, and thanks for spending time with my site.</h1>
                <p>I am a graduate of the Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science program with a focus in
                    Software Engineering. I joined the program in March of 2018 and will finish the last class needed at the end
                    of December 2020, with the conferral at the first of January 2021.  The last couple of years have been filled
                    with challenges both with some of the challenging concepts as well as events occurring outside of the program.</p>
            
                <p>Before starting the program, I was self-taught computer hardware enthusiast, I enjoyed building computers for
                    myself and friends, tweaking their performance, and tinkering with modifying pre-existing user-interface and API
                    calls for information within those UIs. So, entering the software engineering side of the computer science
                    program was a dive into the deep end to learn and survive or fail and drown test for me. I enjoyed working with
                    the hardware and the UIs but, considered it nothing more than a hobby when I initially went to college and
                    instead followed my interests in physics and math down the path into Respiratory Care.</p>
            
                <p>I worked in the Respiratory Care field for nearly 13 years specializing in Neonatal Intensive Care and
                    Cardiovascular Intensive Care. It was during this time frame that I was given the opportunity to work with the
                    development teams of two different electronic charting systems, to construct charting modules needed for the
                    hospital system that I worked. While providing information to the teams and working with them on flow of the
                    information and fields that were required, it gave me a chance to see behind the curtain and sparked my interest
                    into software development and looking into a program that would allow me to attend full-time while
                    maintaining full-time employment.</p>
            
                <p>In both education and work I have been able to achieve various acknowledgments. Some through dedication, while
                    others where, in part, to having a solid team that worked well together to keep each other on a positive note
                    and putting our best efforts forward. You can view some of my current achievements at <a href="#"
                        data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-ca">Current Recognitions and Achievements</a>
