                <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                <p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical
                    product creation
                    process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to
                    clients throughout
                    the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the
                    customer and end
                    user.
                </p>

                <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on
                    highly focused
                    communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft
                    the application
                    according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is
                    aligning properly
                    with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
